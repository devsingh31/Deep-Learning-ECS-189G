# Deep Learning Course Project - ECS 189G-001, Winter 2024

## Project Overview
This project involves building deep learning models for various application tasks across multiple stages, contributing to 40% of the final grade. Students will gain hands-on experience with classic deep learning models to solve real-world problems using PyTorch and other relevant tools.

## Stages of the Project

### Stage 1: Group Formation and Environment Setup
- Form groups of up to four students.
- Submit a report on Canvas including team name, student names, IDs, and emails.
- Setup your programming environment including Python, PyCharm, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

### Stage 2: Data Classification with MLP Model
- Implement and train a Multi-Layer Perceptron model to classify a given dataset.
- Experiment with different architectures and settings to improve model performance.
- Document the process and results in a report.

### Stage 3: Image Classification with CNN Model
- Train CNN models to classify different sets of image data, including digits, faces, and colored objects.
- Adjust CNN configurations to explore the impact on performance.
- Summarize findings in a report.

### Stage 4: Text Classification and Generation with RNN Model
- Develop RNN models for classifying and generating text data.
- Modify the RNN architecture, utilizing LSTM and GRU units, and assess changes in performance.
- Report on the experimental process and outcomes.

### Stage 5: Graph Embedding and Node Classification with GNN Model
- Create and train Graph Neural Network models for graph embedding and node classification on various datasets.
- Document the methodology and results in a detailed report.

## Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to ensure your environment is prepared for all stages of the project:

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **PyCharm Setup**: Install PyCharm with an educational license. [Get PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
3. **Library Installation**:
   - Install `scikit-learn` via PyCharm or [official guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html).
   - Install `PyTorch` following the steps at [PyTorch Official](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
4. **Verify Installation**: Ensure both libraries work in PyCharm by running simple test scripts.
5. **Download Project Templates**: Access and prepare the provided code templates for each stage.
